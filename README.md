# PassMaster
Creating an application using C#, Password manager.

Hello!

This is a program I'm actively developing in order to help me learn C#'s syntax. It's a basic CRUD application that uses mySQL
in order to store password information locally on a hard drive. Currently it uses a database named passmaster stored locally, but it creates all the tables it uses if they don't already exist.

The long term prospects for this is for personal use, but I plan to revisit it every so often adding what I've learned to it.

If you somehow stumbled across this page, feel free to add to the project using a pull request. I welcome programmers of every
skill level to add to it, or give me pointers :).
